Technical support is about problem-solving at its core. This is truly the most enjoyable aspect of problem-solving for me. Learning new things while solving customers technical difficulties gives me lots of emotions; happy, satisfied, encouraged, and accomplished. For as long as I can remember, I've completed and enjoyed problem-solving tasks. 

This started with me being the mastermind while building IKEA furniture with my dad. I'd go through the assembly instructions while he did the hard work. Soon after I was paying their invoices online and taking care of their technical difficulties while building HTML websites. I completed a B.Sc degree in mechanical engineering once I came of age. While the main objective of a mechanical engineer is problem-solving, I did not like the lack of technology. I decided to start my B.Sc degree in computer science online.
