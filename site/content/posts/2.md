From [the list](https://gist.github.com/fool/b0f254ff8c72a5765b6a9138249789d6 ) given to me by Chris McGraw, I've composed my favorite, and least favorite things in no particular order.

### My 5 favorite things to do:
---

- Engage multiple users at once via chat to answer their questions and troubleshoot problems
- Work with people to figure out if Netlify's service can solve a particular workflow or integration challenge they have
- Analyze thousands of support tickets to spot trends to improve our product
- Debug a customer's build using a programming language and framework that you've never seen before
- Set up your own copy of several static site frameworks for debugging

Given that I work best under pressure and enjoy problem-solving activities, these are the activities that excite me the most. 

### My 5 least favorite things to do:
---

- Respond to Netlify fans on Twitter
- Create video tutorials to help teach users a specific feature or use case
- Write and maintain documentation for our software and blog posts for our website.
- Work with prospective customers to explain our service and the pricing model
- Find and recruit teammates for the support team

This list should not be interpreted as a dislike list. These are simply activities that seem more dull compared to the others.
