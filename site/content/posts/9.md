>Explain, in a couple of paragraphs, what you think 2 major challenges around DNS configuration are for less-technical internet end-users

Changes to your DNS do not happen instantly, it can take up to 48 hours to take effect on the whole internet.

This, accompanied with your computer having a DNS cache containing the old IP address for a specific time, TTL(Time To Live), can have domain owners hopping straight to customer support stating nothing happens after the changes and wondering if they set up their DNS correctly. 

The same internet end-users might not know that in order for both the www.domain and apex domain to work, both of them need to be set up. To complicate it even further, if you configure your apex domain with a CNAME record, you can't set any other records for it You will not be able to set up email(MX record), nor validate your ownership for Google Search Console(TXT record).
