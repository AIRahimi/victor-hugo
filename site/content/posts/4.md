Fucking A! I didn't expect the auto-publishing function. It's amazing that all I have to do on my computer is push to git and it get's published instantly. I honestly fell in love with the automated platform. The incredible super optimized servers and the super fast loading of sites have definitely made me a customer regardless of my job application. Ease of use of the development tools was an enjoyement as well. 

I thoroughly enjoyed the simple, yet easily navigable UI. As well as the splendid documentation pages with videos.
