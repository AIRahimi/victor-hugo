>(optional/bonus) Can you set up a redirect from “/netlify/anything” to https://www.google.com/search?q=anything ?

By having a _redirects file in the root folder, one can easily configure redirect and rewriter rule for their Netlify site.

I had some trouble setting it up since I found no documentation on where the _redirects file should be located in the Victor Hugo boilerplate. I figured it belongs in /site/static/ after trial and error.
