>Could you give us a suggestion to improve this test or the job posting?

I would recommend you give a time frame for the project and ask us to get back in touch if we need more time in case life is in the way. <!--more-->

Setting a time frame would get rid of the less serious contenders that don't tackle time pressure. 


I was babysitting my sister at my parents' house while they were traveling so I couldn't get to work until two days after I received the tasks. I thought about getting in touch and letting you know, but figured I'll finish it a couple of days later and let you know afterward. You should also further clarify if our task is to deploy using StaticGen (Victor-Hugo) or if we may use a fresh Hugo build.

The job posting is amazingly written and very thorough. You should know that I admire your principles. 

>We donâ€™t discriminate against employees or applicants based on gender identity or expression, sexual orientation, religion, age, race, citizenship, pregnancy status, or any other differences. 

This is the quote that motivated me to truly do my best at these tests and try to score the position as Support Engineer @ Netlify. I have no suggestions to the actual job posting, it's simply amazing.
