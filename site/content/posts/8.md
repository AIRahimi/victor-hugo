>Why do you think SSL/HTTPS is important?

While on a unsecured website all communication with the server can be exploited by people with bad intentions. You can avoid this by switching over to HTTPS protocol.

HTTPS is simply HTTP that runs over TSL(its predecessor being SSL). With a HTTPS protocol, all information transmitted between you and the server becomes encrypted. Authentication is provided as well so that you can be safe knowing only the right server can decrypt and read your information.
Although I believe SSL/TSL is extremly imporant because of the security it offers, there are more reasons to use it now than ever. 

- Browsers let the user know if the connection to the website is not secured.
- HTTPS is faster as browsers only support HTTP/2 over TSL. 
- Studies have found a correlation between HTTPS and search engine rankings.
