>Provide a link to documentation for a technical/developer-focused product, that you think are well done, and briefly explain why you think they are well done.

I believe [Scala](http://docs.scala-lang.org/) has the best documentation I have laid my eyes on thus far. The inclusion of a cheatsheet, version documentation, and the formal language specification makes it easily navigable and organized for working users of Scala.

Recently discoverers of Scala don't miss anything either. The introductory documentation is amazing and covers everything weather Scala is your first programming language or you have experience with Java. With the addition of well-done learning resources, amongst others [Scala Exercises](https://www.scala-exercises.org/), I believe they have done documentation right.
